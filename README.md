When the user inputs a file, the program reads it, converts its contents to uppercase characters using Python's inbuilt upper() method. 
The file is then repacked and saved with a prefix "output_" then its previous file name.
If the file isn't found, the user gets an error "the file XXXX doesn't exist."
Other conditions like UAC are also considered in the exception.
